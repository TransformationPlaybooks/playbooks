To enable alignment of ways of working and the way work is done, individuals with similar capabilities are brought together in to grouping commonly called chapters, and then chapters of like skill sets are aligned into Areas (Chapter Areas). Once completed it becomes easier to ensure the appropriate training, resourcing, mentoring, and coaching to the specific skills of the chapter as well as a higher level cross-view of the different chapters within an Area.

Individuals across the whole organisation now get to maintain and enhance their skill sets ensuring personal growth, technology advances and organisation practices related to their area are followed. Also the advantage of having the people brought together like this allows shared knowledge of what is happening across teams and what is working best.

From an Individual point of view &#39;Team&#39; is the people that are worked with on a daily basis, a Group is an alignment of outcomes that a team is delivering to and a Chapter Lead is similar to a line manager and the chapter is home.

**Chapter Area Lead**

The chapter area lead is responsible for all the chapters in their area and for ensuring they understand and provide the correct resourcing to the chapters, budgeting and support, while also making sure the company is strategically getting the best understanding of the resources available and needed organisationally wide.

They need to focus on cost constraints, labour constraints, hire constraints as well as considering re-structures and the organisation transforms its workforce.

They have a great interest in reducing future surprises in demand.

**Chapter Lead**

A Chapter lead responsible for ensuring their chapter has the correct collection of like skilled people so that they can contribute to meeting the required knowledge needs being demanded by delivery teams. This will included the training, cross skilling and upskilling of the members of the chapter ensuring that relevancy is maintained, best practices are practiced, tooling knowledge is up to date and learnings are shared with in the chapter.

Part of leading a chapter includes balancing the cost of being able to supply with the constraints of priorities and budgets. Meaning that leads need to understand what the individuals in their chapter are working on and work closely with Group and Product Owners in pre-empting knowledge and skill needs as well as potential people constraints. This helps ensure that delivery planning sessions such as Quarterly reviews expectations are realistic, and opportunities or challenges can be worked through.
