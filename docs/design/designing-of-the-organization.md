# The Designing of the Organization

Although there are lots of nuances the goal is to provide visibility to people, at all levels across an organisation, their purpose;

What work is the priority focus

Who is doing the work

There is much that needs to be done to get to answer these simple questions and provide high visibility these get covered elsewhere, for now our focus is creating the design that will enable.

## Demand

The team, groups or areas of the organisation take on ownership of strategic pieces of work and delivery of customer outcome(s) and experience(s), in some customers this is called a  **Game Plan**  as it is part of an organisational review process (such as QBR - Quarterly Business Review), while each cross-functional team within the group still owns an outcome (team charter) to achieve the group goal.

## Supply

Under the type of structure described above, there is a need to help individuals across the whole organisation maintain and enhance their skill sets to ensure not only personal growth, keeping up with technology and practice advances, but also to share knowledge and maintain the best possible outcomes for customers. To achieve this, individuals of a skill set are aligned into  **Chapters** and then chapters of similar skill sets are aligned into **Areas (Chapter Areas)** this skill alignment allows for appropriate training, resourcing, mentoring, and coaching to the specific skills of the chapter as well as a higher level cross-view of the different chapters within an Area.

## Summary

From an Individual point of view  **&#39;Team&#39;**  is the people that are worked with on a daily basis, a  **Group**  is an alignment of outcomes that a team is delivering to and a  **Chapter Lead**  is a line manager.

These groupings allow users to reason about **What Work they&#39;re going to do** (planning) - and then _prioritise_ that.

They can then moderate these plans with a view of **who&#39;s available to do the work** (supply of people), and who is selected **to do the work** (people demand).

Then overlaying information from financial systems, to provide a view of **how much the work will cost**.

Enabling insights on the future people and skill demand for _Workforce Planning_ and _Budgetary Forecasting_.
