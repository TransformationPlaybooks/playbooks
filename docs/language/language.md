# Language

It is very easy to be talking about very different things using the same words or similarly talking about the same thing and using different words. This can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, process brake downs and unnecessary repetition of work and fear.

One of the first steps in either simply mapping a current Organisational design or creating a new Organisational design is ensure that the team doing this has agreed what the language is and the meaning of specific term regarding the work that is about to be undertaken. This is also commonly known as aligning the taxonomy

Below I have attempted to create some groupings of similar concepts with a description and some of the common different language that use used by Organisations.
