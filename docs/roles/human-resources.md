## Who is Human Resources

This is the area of the company typically responsible for ensuring that the organization has the people available to do it's priority work.  

Human Resources typically responsible for workforce strategy, analytics, employee-facing processes (onboarding, offboarding, remuneration, ...), corporate communications, and change management for people & processes.  

In a transformation program this area will likely also lean in on how work is done (the organization's way of working), changing line management structures, and updating new employment contracts where there are material changes.  

## Languange: Also Known As

When we say Human Resources (HR), we mean any corporate capability that does the above work.  Now also known as:
* People and Culture
* People Operations
* ...


## Human Resources in an agile transformation
 
As a transformation scales, Human Resources will likely get involved at multiple points.  While often cast as disruptive to HR professionals, agile transformation offer a multitude of opportunities to improve how work is done, improve employee experience identifying and reducing painful processes, reducing costs by reducing the overheads required to work on products and projects, and improve the capacity to get priority work done by ensuring that the right people with the right skills are available for the teams that need them. 

First we speak to the shift underway.

### Transformation drivers affecting Human Resources

To recap, the main change underway is a shift of work from principally *project-driven* teams, where project teams exist for fixed timeframes and tend to have fixed deliverables and budgets, to an ongoing and persistent *product-driven* teams that deliver an ongoing offering to the organization.  

See the main article on transformation drivers here (FIXME - link).

### pivoting to a product-driven view

In a *project-driven* organization, people tend to be organised by corporate function (sales, engineering, marketing, legal, finance).  When work in the form of projects needs to be done, people are assigned out to projects.  This leads to two behaviours
1. line management is unchanged, eg an engineering manager will allocate people from her area to projects.  Checking in with the relevant project manager(s) to assess the quality of their charges' work.  
2. internal cost accounting ensures that the cost of those people is accounted to the projects they work on.  This answers the bigger question "what did we accomplish this year?" at all levels of the organization by looking a project an project status.  

When moving to a *product-driven* organization, human resources professionals will help pivot these aspects to a different structure where:
1. line management is organized by role, skill, or capability.  often company-wide.  this creates supply-side talent pools that can then be allocated out to product teams for extended durations. 
2. cost accounting and controls shift to a team-centric view.  The labour costs to build and operate a product persistently is the sum of people working in those product teams, and any support structures above them.  Although corporate cost constraints can also be applied from supply side pools (eg "I don't want to have more than 15% of my workforce be comprised of lawyers", or "I want to keep contractors and consultants to less than 25% of my Human Resources spend")

lets look into these with more detail

## Human Resources and the shift to supply-side talent pools

By supply-side talent pool, we mean how people with similar roles/capabilities/skills will be grouped together. See [the designing of the organization](../design/designing-of-the-organization.md) and [supply talent pools and roles in depth](../design/supply/supply-talent-pools-and-roles-in-depth.md) to learn more.  

Human Resources can play a critical role in helping to setup and maintain these talent pools
* working with demand-side team leads on understanding the capabilities that their teams require
* assembling known lists of people with these capabilities in the organisation
* building a basic contextual understanding of which focus areas/projects/products people currently have
* identifying current and potential leaders of people, who will be responsible for forecasting and recruiting their people needs based on (funded, prioritised) business demand

This will support initial conversations on establishing the supply-side groupings. Once decisions have been made, it is likely that moving individuals from their current line management structure to the new supply-side groupings will require a change in employment contract to note this.  

## the importance of forecasting to recruitment and training

In practice, most *project-driven* organizations struggle with bringing in the talent they require once a project is given the go-ahead and funded.   Good project managers will do pre-work to understand what the likely availability of candidate people are, but in practice this is difficult to do at scale.  What typically ends up happening is that projects have a very slow start as recruitment happens, or people wait to be freed up from other work, or short term contractors or consultants are brought in to fill the gap.  

In contrast, the long-lived persistent *product-driven* teams that agile transformations tend to favour have data to show that the project spin-up/spin-down cycle inflicts a considerable cost and time penalty.  So, when building product-driven teams the intent is to keep team members, and so demand from supply-side groupings more constant over time.  Typically organizations aim for a 5-10% annual rate of change.   

Human Resources professionals now have the opportunity to work with supply-side leaders of people to work out their forecasted needs.   Because teams are moving to a more stable form, this enables the organization undergoing the transition to consider multiple ways of fulfilling their needs
1. by recruitment, either as employees or bringing in contractors.  Leaders of people will need guidance on establishing the right mix to balance cost, flexibility, and persistency.  This is one of the major area where cost savings can be made, as in our experience it allows a change from mostly-contract/consultant roles to a more employee-heavy mix.   Employees are typically less expensive to fund long term, due to their lower day rates and overheads.  
2. by training.  Major changes in ways of working typically brought in with a transformation will see the demand for some roles and skills drop considerably (eg business analysts and project managers are often called out), while others tend to increase significantly (product owners, scrum masters, software architects, software user interface specialists).  While these roles are different, it's often the case that there is a constrained market supply for the in-demand roles.  For the right individuals, this creates a golden opportunity for human resources to lead in re-training existing employees for the new needs.   The advantage of this approach, while slower, it keeps people in the business that have a lot of accumulated context and expertise.  We also note that transformations happen over extended timelines compabile with re-training, as long as the forecasts are reasonably accurate!


# how Human Resources can help overcome the major challenges of agile transformations, and reap their Benefits
Based on research from the [Business Agility report, in our references](../references.md).

Research shows that transformations have a few common aspects
* they tend to be done at larger organizations; research shows that over half in play are in organizations with over 1000 people
* they take years, with significant benefits being provided at the 2 year marke
* they have common top challenges

The main challenges that Human Resources can help with are 
1. Resistance to Change, which is related to unsuitable organizational structure for the work being done, and staff not understanding *why* the transformation is happening.   The change to product-driven teams, with people organised into supply-side groupings providing these teams with the capabilities they need to succeed and get their done is one of the big transformative aspects that addresses unsuitable organizational structures.  Human Resources also tends to house the corporate communications capability which is central to communicating the *why*.

2. Difficulty scaling, which is related to a shortage of skilled personnel.  The recruitment & training options listed above can go a long way in addressing this challenge, particularly when informed by good forecasts from teams and other demand-side groupings.  

The main benefit that Human Resources will reap are
1. improved Employee Satisfaction.  when well executed, a transformation program can significantly reduce the procedural overheads of work that are particularly prominent in *project-driven* organisations.   People are simply happier when they can focus on their core work, over bureaucracy.  
2. improved Adaptability.  with the right talent mix, and supply-side collections of this talent, organizations can more quickly pivot to new market opportunities, respond to significant market changes, or even to major disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic.  

# conclusion
An agile transformation presents a significant opportunity for human resources professional to facilitate, communicate, and staff the change that's underway.   We have observed several people in this space have their careers launched to greater responsibilities and strategic input along the process.
