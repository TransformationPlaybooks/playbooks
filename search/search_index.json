Within these groups the individual cross functional teams are still responsible for owning slices of the work they need to complete. Together all these cross functional Team deliver the Objectives which in turn achieve the Organisation Goals and fulfil the customers needs. To ensure a Team can deliver, they are cross function with appropriate individuals from potentially any area of the organisation and bring to the team their expertise, knowledge and abilities. Individuals may also on occasions move to different teams where there may be needed to augment a solution a team is delivering.

Demand The team, groups or areas of the organisation take on ownership of strategic pieces of work and delivery of customer outcome(s) and experience(s), in some customers this is called a Game Plan as it is part of an organisational review process (such as QBR - Quarterly Business Review), while each cross-functional team within the group still owns an outcome (team charter) to achieve the group goal. Supply Under the type of structure described above, there is a need to help individuals across the whole organisation maintain and enhance their skill sets to ensure not only personal growth, keeping up with technology and practice advances, but also to share knowledge and maintain the best possible outcomes for customers.

Most success has been seen when the whole organisation or at least multiple business units have been transformed at once; these should be aligned to value streams and include but not be solely limited to IT/tech (see: 2021 Business Agility report key findings p.6, detail p.15). Having the strategic organisations outcomes clearly and measurably defined as this will help the business units create their aligned outcomes and in turn define the purpose and out comes of each grouping of teams. Creating Design Guidelines Provide organisational design guidelines that will offer guidance on how the new transformed structure should look and feel from delivery perspective, the talent requests/demands need to be supplied to for successful delivery.some things to consider: How will the new structure be aligned to firstly the customer along with the type of organisation, is the alignment around market segments, services delivered, product types, individual products or something else. We use the term Value Stream to mean how we deliver a discrete piece of value to the end customer. Have the strategic organisations outcomes clearly and measurably defined as this will help the business units create their aligned outcomes, which in turn defines the purpose and out comes of each grouping of teams. How may layers or lines of reporting are possible, the goal here is to minimise the number of layers allowing ownership and decision making closer to where the work is done, clearer and more rapid. What is the desired type of organisational groupings and their sizes at each of the layers, some examples are: Team grouping 8-15 individuals Groupings of teams up-to 150 individuals Business Units 500 up-to say a maximum of 1500 individuals Define any Specialised role types at each of the layers and start defining how these roles fit into the new structure along with their responsibilities. This may include: Product Owner Group of Teams Owner (can also be a product owner) Business Unit of Function owner Coach Srum Master etc Generally Organisation Function and Business Unit supply supporting roles to the Teams responsible for delivering. Delivery Grouping Construction Select which Groupings will be delivering which business outcome(s) this will help understand the number of and types of skill/capabilities required to deliver them. If possible try not to have multiple groups delivering the same business outcome as it will increase dependancies and reduce ownership. design the number teams and what will be the expectation of their delivery contribution, again the more a single team can own a full piece of work the higher the chances of success. build out the teams with the number and types of skill/capabilities need in the teams to deliver, where ever possible it is best to work with the team if it already exists. What skills / capabilities will the grouping provide to support the delivery teams whilst also removing distractions, impediments and other admin task. Some example roles: grouping owner way of working Enablers grouping coach grouping scrum master technical Enabler architect security expert business Enabler finance risk Talent to Demand Needs Start putting the names of individuals currently known that are already be doing the work in some form against the demand design needs created in the Delivery Grouping Construction stage above. Depending on the transformation the organisation has gone through the matching of Talent to the demand needs could be done by the Talent supply leads. It may be possible or make sense to move whole existing teams into the newly built Grouping design. This will then highlight where there may be challenges filling roles or glut of people that can be mapped to other groupings or teams. Once complete this will provide good visability into the to the organisations talent pools: available today, available internally within 3-6mo with training, need to be recruited/sourced from outside Balance with Priorities A form of 'Market Place' makes visible the constraints that exist for the parts of the organisation that are undergoing this transformation. The constraint challenges at a high level will generally be around available or capacity talent and funding. Show the capacity contains for the number of people required to do the work with in each team and group. It may mean that some teams will need to fold together. There is nearly always more work than people, understanding the capacity constraints will help prioritise what it is really important. Funding also plays an important constraint against the work and the number of people, again this constraint will help focus on the important work. Using the organisations strategies, people constraints and funding constraints, Prioritise the highest delivered value and strategic work while keeping the customer at front of mind. With all the new constraint information this generally leads to revisiting outcomes and capacity that will be made available for each team and grouping Capture where future recruitment, cross training or up skill will meet future skill and capacity needs to help the future of the organisation achieve its customers goals. Often there is a process with some iterations where visibility is honed and conversations continue attempting to resolve contention and constraints (eg cost). Agreement On the completion of market place the following should clearly defined and agreed on: Groupings and their teams Agreed and locked funding The people that will provide the capacity within the Resources grouping and teams The time period before next design review, example quarterly seems to be common in larger organisations. Communicate Both the Delivery demand and Talent supply groupings need to work together to ensure that individuals feel secure, confident and informed. Transparency, trust and communications play key roles in a transforming organisation, once it is possible clearly communicated to individuals that are effected by the new structure and team designs letting them know the following minimum information: There role in the new ways of working structure Expectations of them in their role What team they will be members and who are the other members in the team Who has an Agile specialist role with in the team and what is the purpose of the role What other teams are in the grouping Who is the grouping owner If only areas of the organisation are transforming, it is also just as important to let the rest of the organisation know what is going on to avoid rumours and panic. Kickoff (start) Event for Groupings These events bring everyone together (live or virtually) so that the same message is delivered and received by all. Some of the things that should be covered off are Expectations with in the group like The expected interactions with in the Grouping cadences (example showcases, sprint lengths, Group meetings) Best way for teams to interact with in the group How impediments can be managed or raised. Who are the grouping Enablers and best way to interact and maximise their value. How product owners with in the team will provide delivery expectation of the teams Radiation of team progress Try, Learn, Iterate Implementing and running the new organisational design will provide an abundance of learnings, a regular cadence should be in place to ensure that these learnings are reviewed and implemented. Try not to implement all things all the time, this will lead to change fatigue and potentially confusion, pick the items that will provide the highest team delivery outcomes.

The Grouping Owner is responsible for working with all the Product Owners with in the individual teams in the group to create the delivery plan or game plan for the group. Grouping level product owners needs to ensure that all the Product Owners are aligned to deliviering tAlso The Product Owner is the champion for the Business, representing the customer's interest and focused on understanding the business and market requirements. Bridging the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, writes customer centric items (generally user stories), prioritises them based on the importance and dependencies, adds them to the backlog, demonstrates the solution to key stakeholders, announces releases (this could even be an email of a small iterative release, or a big bang marketing release), negotiates priorities, scope funding (generally with help from the Scrum Master). Currently in Telstra some of these functions are shared with the BA's, Team Leads and Project or Iteration managers. The Development Team or The Team (a collection of people) All though the term Development team is used in Scrum and other agile ways of working it does not always mean all the people in the team are software engineers (people who write code). The Development Team is a team of people typically between 5-15 (15 being the upper limit) individuals that have a simple goal of working together to develop the outcome or product. In Agile Scrum the team is self-organising, meaning it is the team members and not outsiders' role to identify which competencies are required (or lacking) to achieve their goal. At this point if the Team decides that an Architect is a skill set the team needs then so be it. Typically, you will find that the Lead Developer has the knowledge of the individuals required to make the team, but ultimately, it's still a team decision. Also, with in the Scrum model there is encouragement of a multi-disciplinary culture where roles overlap (one of the reasons it is also very popular with start-ups), The purpose here is to give people a much better understanding of the value of other roles in the team as well as discourage egos within individuals. You might have heard people talking about the T model of Skills for people in a team, multi-disciplinary with deep knowledge in at least one area. The PRODUCT OWNER Also The Product Owner is the champion for the Business, representing the customer's interest and focused on understanding the business and market requirements. Bridging the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, writes customer centric items (generally user stories), prioritises them based on the importance and dependencies, adds them to the backlog, demonstrates the solution to key stakeholders, announces releases (this could even be an email of a small iterative release, or a big bang marketing release), negotiates priorities, scope funding (generally with help from the Scrum Master). Currently in Telstra some of these functions are shared with the BA's, Team Leads and Project or Iteration managers. The product owner also owns the responsibility of managing the teams backlog ensuring that everyone understands and agrees the with the features in the backlog. Ultimately the product owner becomes the decision maker as they own the backlog. This where a lot of organisational challenges start, it is also why it is extremely important the product owner represents the customers/stakeholders that the solution/product is being built for and focuses on optimising the value of The Development Team's output. This role via the backlog should be stopping 'un-needed wants' or 'low-priority/low-value wants' being pumped into scope which leads to inflated projects/products/costs. Understands product vision Defines the features of the Product, decides on the release date and content Is responsible for the profitability of the Product (ROI) Prioritises features according to market value Can change features and priority every Sprint Accepts or rejects work results negotiates Acceptance Criteria for work results The SCRUM MASTER Is a role is generally the one that, in conjunction with the Product Owner, replaces the Project Manager as there is no need for a Project Manager directly with in a Scrum team. This role can be challenging as it is facilitator for the team and the Product Owner, ensuring that the team follows the processes that the team has agreed upon; remembering different teams may have agreed on different processes. Some examples of the processes/ceremonies include daily stand-ups, time boxing meetings, removing blockers that prevent the developers from continuing with their work, retrospectives, grooming sessions, sprint estimate and planning sessions. Also, the Scrum master is responsible for the sprint backlog (the work that will be completed in a sprint, which is driven by the team backlog managed by the Product Owner). In the current Telstra environment this individual would also work closely with the product owner to do the reporting (burn down, burn up, velocity, etc) as well as budget reporting, they also provide coaching to the team, Product Owners, and even Externals to the Team. Auxiliary Roles The PROJECT MANGER There are cases where there is a need for a project manager, but this is not with in a team, when there is large, highly distributed multi-team environments with high-risk profiles, complex processes and complex governance. Projects with multiple scrum teams divided by release or component need that additional layer of co-ordination as team generally focus on their tasks and there are likely to be non-agile dependencies' within and without the project which don't work to the rhythm of the scrum teams. Enterprise level projects can involve a series of initiation activities before the Scrum-based delivery gets started, this critically includes what is NOT in scope, some architectural and technology decisions, project managers can bring a wealth of planning skills. Its important to note that this are Agile Project Managers and need to fit with in the Agile philosophy of delegating as much detail into the team(s) as possible, not the traditional method of 'command and control' style of project management This leave 3 main areas of responsibility for the Project Manager \u25e6 a buffer to the outside environment \u25e6 a support to the team \u25e6 a co-ordinator. The ARCHITECT Generally, an architect is at the group level and becomes part of the support crew for the teams of the group, in more complex problem spaces it is also possible that an architect is a member within The Development Team, there are also situations where there would not be enough work within one team so often the Architects are expected to work across multiple teams and even projects. In these types of scenarios, the Architect can end up outside of the Scrum team be either a Stakeholder or a consultant to the Scrum team. For example, an enterprise, system or infrastructure architect may have have concerns or feature requirements related to what is being developed. They may want to ensure a system complies with an organisation standard or fits an architectural strategy, in these cases they will be looking to influence the Product Owner's decision about what gets put in the backlog and how it is prioritised thus making the Architect a stakeholder.

Allow deployment of the workforce more objectively ensuring that people are working on the agreed highest customer and business priorities within the delivery organisation. Insight and visibility where talent hotspots or gluts exist that may be holding back the organisation. Provides opportunities for optimisation, up-skilling and cross skilling. Simplify talent pool specific skill development, being able to bring the right levels of knowledge to the work, and better share this knowledge. Maximising consistency of the delivery model across the organisation, with consistent messaging of each talent pools' role responsibilities. Understand talent mix by employment instrument. That is, understanding the mix of permanent employees, contractors, and consultants in each talent pool. The adjustment of which affects labour cost, flexibility, and risk exposure. Preparation Clearly define the talent pools that will be covered in this new agile reporting line design, remembering the concept of delivery teams will create demand requests. This new design needs to enable a simple and intuitive mechanism for requesting talent, optionally specifying the skill level, experience, and specialisation attributes these people have. The result should allow a reduction of reporting layers, and facilitate skill development opportunities within the talent pools. Similar to the delivery team design, successful transformations pivot the whole organisation at once, or - for larger orgs - include multiple business units aligned to one or more value streams (see: 2021 Business Agility report key findings p.6, detail p.15). Note that when a transformation program is split into parts (or waves, or phases) processes will need to be adjusted to allow a blend of agile team supply structures to operate alongside more traditional line management centric talent pools. This hybrid approach will introduce another level of complexity towards responsibilities, ownership, priorities and interactions. Creating Design Guidelines Provide design guidelines that offer guidance on how the new talent pool structure should look and feel from a 'supply' perspective. This is the talent that will be supplied to meet the delivery teams' demands. Some things to consider: What is the desired type of Talent pool groupings and how many layers of groupings will there be; with the aim of keeping the layers as shallow as possible. A recommendation is no more than 3 or 4, this still allows for the right type and depth of conversations when prioritisation calls are being made regarding the work and people. Some examples: Overarching Talent groups, such as full stack engineers, or marketing Groupings of talent within the overarching, such as full stack engineers with java specialisation, or retail consumer marketing Detailed grouping within the Groupings example: Advanced Java full stack engineers or small retail consumer marketing The preferred sizing of the groupings balances communication and trust against the size and level of the grouping. Some examples: Overarching talent type 500 to a maximum of 1500 individuals Groupings of talent types, up to 150 individuals Detail grouping of talent types, 8-15 individuals What skills and capabilities will be needed to support the allocation of talent to the delivery demands. This includes an ongoing understanding of the work, knowledge and evolution of common practices in delivering the work, recruitment, optimisation and general management. Some example roles are: Overarching Talent Lead common terms are Chapter Area Lead or Domain Area Lead Talent grouping lead common terms is Chapter Lead Detail grouping lead common term is sub chapter Specialist roles Scrum Master Release Train Engineer Enablement groupings Establishing clear responsibilities for these roles will reduce the complexity of interactions at each level of talent grouping. It will also ensure individuals can be clear of their role when placed within their delivery teams. Talent to Demand Needs Delivery defines the business outcomes needed to fulfil the organisation's strategy. Then, working with the Talent (supply) areas, they capture the desired amount and types of talent that will they require for success. Doing this across all the areas of the organisation provides collective visibility as to what the talent needs are, and to which priorities they will be working. Understand the work behind each demand request, and how it aligns to the organisations' strategies and priorities. This can be more objectively enabled if an agreed measure is chosen to rank the demand requests (DVF, WSJF, cost of delay, perceived value vs cost, and many other ways) Start assigning the available talent to the teams, ensuring that in cases of contention the highest priority outcomes are worked on first. Contention is very likely. There is always more work than talent and funding, so this matching gives an understanding the capacity constraints. Allow Delivery to either revisit their priorities, pool similar work better, or enable recruitment to fulfil the Talent demands Often this is a process that includes iterations where visibility is honed, and conversations continue attempting to resolve contention and constraints. Sometimes not all things can be resolved, this needs to be escalated, leadership needs to make their now informed decisions and tradeoffs - \"captains calls\" As part of these iterations, it's important for talent pool leaders and delivery leaders to discuss the proposed work with the individuals that would be doing it. This entire process is for naught if individuals refuse their assignments. Communicate Both the Talent supply and Delivery demand groupings need to work together to ensure that individuals feel secure, confident and informed. Transparency, trust and communications play key roles in a transforming organisation. As soon as possible, clearly communicate to individuals that are effected by the new structure and team designs and let them know the following minimum information: Their role in the new ways of working structure Expectations of them in their role What team they will be assigned to, and who are the other members in the team What is the purpose of their team Who has an Agile specialist role within the team, and what is the purpose of the role Which other teams are in the grouping, and what are those teams' purposes Who is the grouping owner If only some areas of the organisation are transforming, it is just as important to let the rest of the organisation know what is going on, so they can understand which work is done where and by who in the new structure. This will minimize negative impact on the flow of work, avoid negative rumours, and reduce the panic or uncertainty often felt by individuals in a major change program. Try, Learn, Iterate Implementing and running the new organisational design will provide an abundance of learnings, a regular cadence should be in place to ensure that these learnings are reviewed and implemented. Try not to implement all things at the same time, as this will lead to change fatigue and potentially confusion. Instead, pick the items that will provide the highest team delivery outcomes. Some examples of what has worked is Quarterly design review in alignment with business outcome based reviews this is when any change in business priorities occur, and the delivery grouping has to take these into account when looking at these priorities, Delivery leads update their forward forecasts so the delivery grouping can understand how they are tracking in their current and future ambitions. This forecasting provides a crucial wealth of information for talent pool planning, skilling, acquisition and better understanding of capacity constraints. Push back on work demands that exceed known talent constraints. Look at ways to enhance individuals' capabilities and their ability to deliver outcomes Example; pipeline management, testing harnesses, industry associations, training etc. Tooling tips or new tooling acquisition to augment or enhance productivity While the work is being reviewed and demand needs are changing, it's a great time to implement some of the organisation design learnings.

This new design needs to enable a simple and intuitive mechanism for requesting talent, optionally specifying the skill level, experience, and specialisation attributes these people have. The result should allow a reduction of reporting layers, and facilitate skill development opportunities within the talent pools. Similar to the delivery team design, successful transformations pivot the whole organisation at once, or - for larger orgs - include multiple business units aligned to one or more value streams (see: 2021 Business Agility report key findings p.6, detail p.15). Note that when a transformation program is split into parts (or waves, or phases) processes will need to be adjusted to allow a blend of agile team supply structures to operate alongside more traditional line management centric talent pools.

A recommendation is no more than 3 or 4, this still allows for the right type and depth of conversations when prioritisation calls are being made regarding the work and people. Some examples: Overarching Talent groups, such as full stack engineers, or marketing Groupings of talent within the overarching, such as full stack engineers with java specialisation, or retail consumer marketing Detailed grouping within the Groupings example: Advanced Java full stack engineers or small retail consumer marketing The preferred sizing of the groupings balances communication and trust against the size and level of the grouping.

Chapter Area Lead The chapter area lead is responsible for all the chapters in their area and for ensuring they understand and provide the correct resourcing to the chapters, budgeting and support, while also making sure the company is strategically getting the best understanding of the resources available and needed organisationally wide.

Now it needs to get people to do the work. Internally: some individuals will be lined up from existing parts of the business, and those skills drawn in. Often we see related subject matter experts, business architects, technical architects, product managers, and a business partner from finance sourced internally. Externally. The bulk of a project's people are likely drawn externally, from contracting, consultancy, or labour hire organisation.

Human Resources typically responsible for workforce strategy, analytics, employee-facing processes (onboarding, offboarding, remuneration, ...), corporate communications, and change management for people & processes. In a transformation program this area will likely also lean in on how work is done (the organization's way of working), changing line management structures, and updating new employment contracts where there are material changes. Languange: Also Known As When we say Human Resources (HR), we mean any corporate capability that does the above work. Now also known as: * People and Culture * People Operations * ... Human Resources in an agile transformation As a transformation scales, Human Resources will likely get involved at multiple points. While often cast as disruptive to HR professionals, agile transformation offer a multitude of opportunities to improve how work is done, improve employee experience identifying and reducing painful processes, reducing costs by reducing the overheads required to work on products and projects, and improve the capacity to get priority work done by ensuring that the right people with the right skills are available for the teams that need them. First we speak to the shift underway. Transformation drivers affecting Human Resources To recap, the main change underway is a shift of work from principally project-driven teams, where project teams exist for fixed timeframes and tend to have fixed deliverables and budgets, to an ongoing and persistent product-driven teams that deliver an ongoing offering to the organization. See the main article on transformation drivers here (FIXME - link). pivoting to a product-driven view In a project-driven organization, people tend to be organised by corporate function (sales, engineering, marketing, legal, finance). When work in the form of projects needs to be done, people are assigned out to projects. This leads to two behaviours 1. line management is unchanged, eg an engineering manager will allocate people from her area to projects. Checking in with the relevant project manager(s) to assess the quality of their charges' work. 2. internal cost accounting ensures that the cost of those people is accounted to the projects they work on. This answers the bigger question \"what did we accomplish this year?\" at all levels of the organization by looking a project an project status. When moving to a product-driven organization, human resources professionals will help pivot these aspects to a different structure where: 1. line management is organized by role, skill, or capability. often company-wide. this creates supply-side talent pools that can then be allocated out to product teams for extended durations. 2. cost accounting and controls shift to a team-centric view. The labour costs to build and operate a product persistently is the sum of people working in those product teams, and any support structures above them. Although corporate cost constraints can also be applied from supply side pools (eg \"I don't want to have more than 15% of my workforce be comprised of lawyers\", or \"I want to keep contractors and consultants to less than 25% of my Human Resources spend\") lets look into these with more detail Human Resources and the shift to supply-side talent pools By supply-side talent pool, we mean how people with similar roles/capabilities/skills will be grouped together. See the designing of the organization and supply talent pools and roles in depth to learn more. Human Resources can play a critical role in helping to setup and maintain these talent pools * working with demand-side team leads on understanding the capabilities that their teams require * assembling known lists of people with these capabilities in the organisation * building a basic contextual understanding of which focus areas/projects/products people currently have * identifying current and potential leaders of people, who will be responsible for forecasting and recruiting their people needs based on (funded, prioritised) business demand This will support initial conversations on establishing the supply-side groupings. Once decisions have been made, it is likely that moving individuals from their current line management structure to the new supply-side groupings will require a change in employment contract to note this. the importance of forecasting to recruitment and training In practice, most project-driven organizations struggle with bringing in the talent they require once a project is given the go-ahead and funded. Good project managers will do pre-work to understand what the likely availability of candidate people are, but in practice this is difficult to do at scale. What typically ends up happening is that projects have a very slow start as recruitment happens, or people wait to be freed up from other work, or short term contractors or consultants are brought in to fill the gap. In contrast, the long-lived persistent product-driven teams that agile transformations tend to favour have data to show that the project spin-up/spin-down cycle inflicts a considerable cost and time penalty. So, when building product-driven teams the intent is to keep team members, and so demand from supply-side groupings more constant over time. Typically organizations aim for a 5-10% annual rate of change. Human Resources professionals now have the opportunity to work with supply-side leaders of people to work out their forecasted needs. Because teams are moving to a more stable form, this enables the organization undergoing the transition to consider multiple ways of fulfilling their needs 1. by recruitment, either as employees or bringing in contractors. Leaders of people will need guidance on establishing the right mix to balance cost, flexibility, and persistency. This is one of the major area where cost savings can be made, as in our experience it allows a change from mostly-contract/consultant roles to a more employee-heavy mix. Employees are typically less expensive to fund long term, due to their lower day rates and overheads. 2. by training. Major changes in ways of working typically brought in with a transformation will see the demand for some roles and skills drop considerably (eg business analysts and project managers are often called out), while others tend to increase significantly (product owners, scrum masters, software architects, software user interface specialists). While these roles are different, it's often the case that there is a constrained market supply for the in-demand roles. For the right individuals, this creates a golden opportunity for human resources to lead in re-training existing employees for the new needs. The advantage of this approach, while slower, it keeps people in the business that have a lot of accumulated context and expertise. We also note that transformations happen over extended timelines compabile with re-training, as long as the forecasts are reasonably accurate! how Human Resources can help overcome the major challenges of agile transformations, and reap their Benefits Based on research from the Business Agility report, in our references . Research shows that transformations have a few common aspects * they tend to be done at larger organizations; research shows that over half in play are in organizations with over 1000 people * they take years, with significant benefits being provided at the 2 year marke * they have common top challenges The main challenges that Human Resources can help with are 1. Resistance to Change, which is related to unsuitable organizational structure for the work being done, and staff not understanding why the transformation is happening. The change to product-driven teams, with people organised into supply-side groupings providing these teams with the capabilities they need to succeed and get their done is one of the big transformative aspects that addresses unsuitable organizational structures. Human Resources also tends to house the corporate communications capability which is central to communicating the why . Difficulty scaling, which is related to a shortage of skilled personnel. The recruitment & training options listed above can go a long way in addressing this challenge, particularly when informed by good forecasts from teams and other demand-side groupings. The main benefit that Human Resources will reap are 1. improved Employee Satisfaction. when well executed, a transformation program can significantly reduce the procedural overheads of work that are particularly prominent in project-driven organisations. People are simply happier when they can focus on their core work, over bureaucracy. 2. improved Adaptability. with the right talent mix, and supply-side collections of this talent, organizations can more quickly pivot to new market opportunities, respond to significant market changes, or even to major disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic. conclusion An agile transformation presents a significant opportunity for human resources professional to facilitate, communicate, and staff the change that's underway.

Look at the people needs of the organisation to deliver the desired outcomes regardless of current hierarchal structure, this can provide detailed insights of what mix of people and capability to deliver what is being aimed for by the organisation has the right mix of people and capability. Then again independently of the organisational structure look at the current mix of people and capability. This matching can show where cross skilling, upskilling, gluts or optimisation opportunities are needed to achieve the right results. Personal and associated costs of delivery of strategic goals provide important indicators to leadership teams and directors if the right amount of the companies investment is focused on the right thing. Often when a whole of organisation rolled up view is available it can be quite different to what was expected.","title":"Accelerator Enablers"},{"location":"template/template-delivery-group-definition/","text":"Mission Intended to keep stakeholders informed and \"at bay\" so as to minimise \"requests for information\".
